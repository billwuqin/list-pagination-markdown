               List Pagination for YANG-driven Protocols
               draft-ietf-netconf-list-pagination-latest

Abstract

   In some circumstances, instances of YANG modeled "list" and "leaf-
   list" nodes may contain numerous entries.  Retrieval of all the
   entries can lead to inefficiencies in the server, the client, and the
   network in between.

   This document defines a model for list pagination that can be
   implemented by YANG-driven management protocols such as NETCONF and
   RESTCONF.  The model supports paging over optionally filtered and/or
   sorted entries.  The solution additionally enables servers to
   constrain query expressions on some "config false" lists or leaf-
   lists.

Acknowledgments

   This work has benefited from the discussions of RESTCONF resource
   collection over the years, in particular,
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-collection] which provides enhanced
   filtering features for the retrieval of data nodes with the GET
   method and [I-D.zheng-netconf-fragmentation] which document large
   size data handling challenge.  The authors would like to thank the
   following for lively discussions on list (ordered by first name):
   Andy Bierman, Martin Björklund, Robert Varga, Rob Wills, and Rob
   Wilton.
